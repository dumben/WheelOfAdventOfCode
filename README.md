# WheelOfAdventOfCode Discord Bot

A Discord bot that randomly selects Advent of Code challenges and automatically posts them every Friday!

## Features

- 🎲 **Random Challenge Selection**: Picks a random year (2015-present) and day (1-25) from Advent of Code
- 💻 **Suggested Language**: Randomly suggests a programming language (Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, or SQL) to add variety to your challenges
- 📅 **Customizable Schedule**: Each server can set its own announcement schedule (defaults to Fridays at 00:01 UTC)
- 🎮 **Manual Spin**: Use the `aoc!spin` command to get a challenge anytime
- ⏰ **Schedule Info**: Check when the next automatic post will happen with `aoc!schedule`
